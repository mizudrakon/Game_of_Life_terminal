	'' (nothing)	-prints the current state on the playground
	integer	n	-returns the playground in the n-th generation
			 from now
	-l number	-prints every step on the way
	i		-insert a pattern as described below (1.,2.)
	f		-lists the content of the 'files' folder
	f number	-number specifies file that contains a pattern
			 we want to insert, we'll have to specify (1.)

2. pattern input:
  0  			dead cell
  x,X 			no change
